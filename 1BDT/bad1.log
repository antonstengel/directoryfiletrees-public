We went into the BDT_insertPath function using GDB and saw that they
did not check if the tree was already initialized. While we cannot
see the rest of the internal implementation, we assume that they should
have checked in this function (though it's possible for an alternative
solution to check in a function and return the INITIALIZATION_ERROR
back upwards--which is something that was also not done).
